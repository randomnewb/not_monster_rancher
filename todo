- [x] Bug: Player flashes when collecting jewels (because these heal the player)
- [ ] Bug: projectile 'stops/'disables' if player spams attack button, allow the projectile exist for its entire duration or until it hits an entity
- [ ] Low Priority: Highlight the tile where the player is 'facing' or looking towards ala Stardew Valley while on mobile mode

  - Requirements
    - [x] Inherits Entity Class
    - [/] AI Behavior via states
      - [x] implemented idle, wander, and destroyed
      - [/] working on chase/follow, attacking/fighting
      - destroyed state
        - [ ] provides droppable items (for example, spawn/drop a jewel in place), provide experience points
        - [x] create a death animation
    - NPC begins its attack very quickly
      - [x] Change how quickly the NPC can engage in its attack (need a little bit of time after the flashes)
    - Once NPC begins to attack, doesn't stop attacking
      - [x] Add in a check so that if the player moves away, the NPC will switch back to idle or wander state

- [/] Bug: issue with state machine and NPC, if the NPC is destroyed (it seems like when this happens in its wander state)
  the game crashes because it is trying to setVelocity - Seems like bug is fixed...

- [ ] Bug: if the player uses keyboard input too quickly after starting a new game and before the map has time to finish generating,
      the game crashes

  - Probably need to implement some sort of loading screen and then allow the player to move and click the screen

- [ ] monsters have spawning requirements (random example, frogs can mate and lay eggs in water tiles)

- [/] To solve rubberbanding issue, implement A-Star into WASD/Arrow key movements to generate an array of
  1 length based on the input, then move player to that location

  - Potentially still buggy, need to test more, player can get stuck and then slide/slow down forever until
    click-to-move is used

- [ ] During generation, generate a barrier of walls or trees along the edges of the map
- [/] Show an indicator of where the player will fire at next or if they can fire at all

- [ ] potential issue with A\*: if original map is edited, need to make sure we update the map in data.js,
      such as if building is implemented or if obstructions are removed, the original array would need to be updated

- Implementing certain actions based on what a mobile user is clicking on

  - [ ] If the player clicks on a tree, the player will move towards the tree and chop it down
  - [ ] If the player clicks on a rock, the player will move towards the rock and mine it
  - [ ] If the player clicks on a monster, the player will move towards the monster and attack it
  - [ ] If the player clicks on a jewel, the player will move towards the jewel and pick it up

- [/] Invincibility added to frog

  - Actually setup frog being invincible during invincibility frames (100 milliseconds)

- [ ] Option to flip touch controls (left/right)

- [/] Health bar implementation

  - Jittery because its position is set to the player's position, need to implement move w/ camera

- [/] Implement one button for mobile

  - [x] Make sure it follows with the camera
  - [ ] (3 different actions [action1, action2, action3], and an inventory action)

- [ ] Attach weapon to the player/add a swing animation with the weapon
- [ ] Add interaction with projectile sprite (use its 16x16 hitbox) and tree tiles

- [ ] Rework tilemap system to include meta data if possible

  - Collidable, interactable, destroyable, drops certain items

- [ ] Implement pre-made structures in tilemap system (like a 2x2-sized tree or small structure)

- [ ] Pressing ESC opens up a pause/options menu

- [ ] Pixel Art: Log/sticks
- [ ] Pixel Art: Pebbles/small stones
- [ ] Pixel Art: General item/bag

- [ ] Interactive objects have outlines around them
- [ ] Continue implementing remaining scenes as their own classes/scripts
- [ ] Rewrite mapping function to map based on length of map rather than hard-coded size

- [ ] (OPTIONAL) Jewels drop out of player on hit
- [ ] Collectibles other than jewels
- [/] Monsters/beasts that wander around, attack player, interact with environment, drop items
- [/] Enemies (that wander around, attack player)
- [ ] Character customization/select screen
- [ ] Life Skills system - chop trees, mine rocks, etc.
- [ ] Water tiles/swimming

- Inventory system via an array or grid inventory (stretch) system
  - [ ] Inventory UI
  - [ ] Inventory slots
  - [ ] Inventory items
  - [ ] Inventory item stats
  - [ ] Inventory item descriptions
  - [ ] Inventory item tooltips
  - [ ] Inventory item drag and drop
  - [ ] Inventory item equip
  - [ ] Inventory item unequip
  - [ ] Inventory item drop
  - [ ] Inventory item use
  - [ ] Inventory item stack
  - [ ] Inventory item split
  - [ ] Inventory item merge
  - [ ] Inventory item sort
  - [ ] Inventory item search
  - [ ] Inventory item filter
  - [ ] Inventory item highlight
- Game world/map also made of a 2d array
  - Broken into zones made of 32x32 tiles
  - Zones have properties like biomes/types, levels, etc. which also contain certain entities
